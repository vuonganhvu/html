<p>Justifed text looks great on a printed page—mainly because the fne resolution
    possible with printing allows for small adjustments in spacing, and because most
    programs used to lay out printed material can hyphenate long words (thus attempting
    to equally distribute the number of characters per line). This prevents large, unsightly
    gaps or rivers of white space ﬂowing through the paragraphs. Web pages are limited
    to much coarser spacing because of the generally low resolution of monitors, and
    because web browsers don’t know how to hyphenate long words. So when you use
    the justify option, the space between words can vary signifcantly from line to
    line, making the text harder to read. When you want to use the justify option on
    your web pages, test it thoroughly to make sure the text is attractive and readable
